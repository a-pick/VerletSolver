## A simple Verlet solver

This Verlet solver is a physics simulation project that utilizes the Verlet integration method to simulate the behavior of objects in a 2D space. 
This project provides a simple implementation of a Verlet solver and allows users to observe the movement and interactions of verlet objects.
Built to further my understanding of C# and graphics libraries (in this case, Raylib).

# How to Use

- Clone the project repository.
- Build and run the project using Visual Studio 2022.
- Enjoy!

# Technologies Used

- C#: The project is developed using the C# programming language with Visual Studio 2022 Community.
- Raylib: The Raylib library is utilized for graphics and window management.
