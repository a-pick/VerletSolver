## A simple Verlet solver

This Verlet solver is a physics simulation project that utilizes the Verlet integration method to simulate the behavior of objects in a 2D space. 
This project provides a simple implementation of a Verlet solver and allows users to observe the movement and interactions of verlet objects.
Built to further my understanding of C# and graphics libraries (in this case, Raylib).

# Features

    - Verlet integration: The project utilizes the Verlet integration algorithm to calculate the positions of objects based on their velocity and acceleration.
    - Object management: The project includes an object manager to handle the creation, storage, and manipulation of verlet objects.
    - Gravity simulation: Gravity is applied to the verlet objects to simulate their response to the gravitational force.
    - Random object spawning: The project provides functionality to spawn multiple verlet objects with randomized initial positions.

# How to Use

    - Clone the project repository.
    - Build and run the project using your preferred development environment.
    - Observe the verlet objects' movement on the screen.
    - Experiment with different parameters, such as object count and gravity, to observe different simulation behaviors.

# Technologies Used

    - C#: The project is developed using the C# programming language using Visual Studio 2022 Community.
    - Raylib: The Raylib library is utilized for graphics and window management.
