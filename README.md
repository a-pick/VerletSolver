## A simple Verlet solver

This project is a physics simulation written in C# based on Pezzza's Work (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS_qeBy3aQI&t=75s) that utilizes the Verlet integration method to simulate the behavior of objects in a 2D space. This project provides a simple implementation of a Verlet solver and allows users to observe the movement and interactions of verlet objects.
Built to further my understanding of C# and graphics libraries (in this case, Raylib).

# How to Use
